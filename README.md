# Twitter_WeRateDog_Project
## Introduction
The dataset which will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. I will use Python (and its libraries) to analyze and vusualize the dataset through jupyter notebook.

### The following packages (libraries) need to be installed:
<ul>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>NumPy</li>
<li>requests</li>
<li>tweepy</li>
<li>json</li>
</ul>
